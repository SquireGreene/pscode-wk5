// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Set variables - number1, number2, sum
Print "Input your first number:"
Input number1
Print "Input your second number:"
Input number2
number1 + number2 = sum
Print "Your total is (sum)."
End



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Set variables - number, sum
Print "Input your number:"
number/2 = sum
If sum = int, Print "Your number is even!", "Your number is odd!"
End


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Set variables - number1, number2, number3, number4, number5, sum, average, smallest, largest
Print "Input number1:"
Print "Input number2:"
Print "Input number3:"
Print "Input number4:"
Print "Input number5:"
average = (number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5)/5
If number1 >= number2, number1 = largest, ELSE number2 = largest
If number3 >= largest, number3 = largest, ELSE largest = largest
If number4 >= largest, number4 = largest, ELSE largest = largest
If number5 >= largest, number5 = largest, ELSE largest = largest

If number1 <= number2, number1 = smallest, ELSE number2 = smallest
If number2 <= smallest, number2 = smallest, ELSE smallest = smallest
If number3 <= smallest, number3 = smallest, ELSE smallest = smallest
If number4 <= smallest, number4 = smallest, ELSE smallest = smallest 

Print " The average of your number is (average). The largest number is (largest) and the smallest number is (smallest)."
